# DISCWebsite
DISC Website for project of Summer 2016 with using Firebase as backend so we should only worry about frontend

In development with goal of end of Summer 16 (ALL SUMMER 16)
This website is for ASU DISC and is built with help of the provided backend of Firebase. Plan for this website is to make it accessible using basic Javascript (at most Jquery) and Bootstrap so future DISC staff can carry this website forward, and not RUBY ON RAILS!
